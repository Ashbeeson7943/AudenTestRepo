### Reasoning

I have created three Scenarios as I felt like this was the minimum needed to satisfy the criteria required. I would continue to expand on these to add more variety if I was to spend a large amount of time on this as well as increase the amount Assertions and add in any other checks. The scenarios I used were a test using the minimum amount the slider could be. The Same again for the maximum value and finally one which sets teh value and attempts to set the payment date to be on a weekend to verify if it is possible.
To accomplish the task I have used a combination of Selenium, NUnit and Specflow as these are the main tools required for automating any webbased application using BDD (Behaviour Driven Development). Although other tools are available I am the most comfortable with these which helped speed up the setting of this project. I created the project in C# using Visual Studio as I had it readily available on the Machine I was working on. I also used Git and GitHub as my VCS to make life a bit easier with any transfers accross machines that need to happen.

### Issues Faced

So for this project I faced on issue mainly which was the automation of the slider. As I couldn't quite it to move the way I wanted it to. Hopefully what I was trying to do comes across but I decided to focus more on getting the MVP done and come back to the issue.

I had a small issue with running the tests as visual studio took a while to realise that they were there. This could be due to the fact I don't have as much experience with Visual studio than other IDE's.


### Next Steps

If I was to continue working on this project my first task would be to resolve the issue faced with moving the slider. I believe I must be missing something but haven't determined what it is. Yet. Along those Lines I would also add some more varied scenarios in as well. I did notice that there were some radio buttons that appeared for certain dates so I would need to add int he functionalit to cater for them as well but they appeared to be uncommon which is why I haven't already added them in although I have the solution already in mind.'
I would also add in additional checks for the repayments at the bottom to make sure all those values are checked.
